'''
Task:-
Given a string S consisting of the characters 0, 1 and 2. Your task is to find the length of the smallest substring of string S that contains all the three characters 0, 1 and 2. If no such substring exists, then return -1.
'''

'''
Example 1:- 
Input:
S = 10212
Output:
3
Explanation:
The substring 102 is the smallest substring
that contains the characters 0, 1 and 2.
'''

'''
Example 2:- 
Input: 
S = 12121
Output:
-1
Explanation: 
As the character 0 is not present in the
string S, therefor no substring containing
all the three characters 0, 1 and 2
exists. Hence, the answer is -1 in this case.
'''

'''
Complexity:- 
 Expected Time Complexity: O( length( S ) )
 Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
'''

'''
Constraints:- 
 1 â‰¤ length( S ) â‰¤ 10^5
 All the characters of String S lies in the set {'0', '1', '2'}
